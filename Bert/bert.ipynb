    "2. High Computational Cost: BERTâ€™s Transformer-based architecture is resource-intensive in terms of memory and compute, both for pre-training and fine-tuning.  \n",
    "3. Ineffective at Understanding Long-Term Dependencies: Although BERT excels at local dependencies, its self-attention mechanism struggles to effectively model long-term dependencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention.  \n",
